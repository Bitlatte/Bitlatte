### Current Projects

### Who is Bitlatte
Think of me (Bitlatte) as a less functional, caffine and adrineline driven, professional hobbiest.
Basically speaking... I\'m a developer. A developer who, despite my attempts, can never seem
to come up with any reasonable ideas. A developer who always has to learn new technology.
And last but not least, a developer whos Github will probably always be dryer than the sahara.

### Open Source
Do I currently contribute to open source? No. Would I like to? Yes. I am a strong supporter of
open source projects and while I have been at this whole development thing for quite some time
I still have yet to take a deep dive into open source contributions. Maybe this will be something
I work on in the near future.

### Plans
Plans are for rookies, real programmers don\'t save before walking away from the computer.
Real programmers don\'t error handle. And most importantly, real programmers use the same
basic commit message when pushing code to a repo... "Initial Commit"
