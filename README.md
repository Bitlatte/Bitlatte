### Who is Bitlatte
Think of me (Bitlatte) as a less functional, caffine and adrineline driven, professional hobbiest.
Basically speaking... I\'m a developer. A developer who, despite my attempts, can never seem
to come up with any reasonable ideas. A developer who always has to learn new technology.
And last but not least, a developer whos Github will probably always be dryer than the sahara.

### Open Source
Do I contribute to open source? No. Would I like to? Yes. Will I? Probably not due to this irrational
but completely rational fear of some all mighty programming god showing up and finding a 1%
more efficient solution than me.

### Plans
Plans are for rookies, real programmers don\'t save before walking away from the computer.
Real programmers don\'t error handle. And most importantly, real programmers use the same
basic commit message when pushing code to a repo... "Initial Commit"
