### Currently Working on :pencil2:
* Learning Flutter
* Building an awesome website

### Who is Bitlatte :question:
Think of me (Bitlatte) as a less functional, caffine and adrineline driven, professional hobbiest.
Basically speaking... I\'m a developer. A developer who, despite my attempts, can never seem
to come up with any reasonable ideas. A developer who always has to learn new technology.
And last but not least, a developer whos Github will probably always be dryer than the sahara.

### Plans :scroll:
Plans are for rookies, real programmers don\'t save before walking away from the computer.
Real programmers don\'t error handle. And most importantly, real programmers use the same
basic commit message when pushing code to a repo... "Initial Commit"
